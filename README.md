# SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Mateusz Stasik

## ABOUT ME

Hi! I’m Mateusz  — I really enjoy apps that make everyday life easier and more efficient. I’m currently transitioning into a career as a software tester because I care deeply about ensuring technology works smoothly and reliably. I’m motivated to contribute to making digital products better, more intuitive, and genuinely helpful for users. My background and curiosity drive me to find bugs, improve user experience, and help deliver flawless software.

This portfolio shows what I’ve learned so far in manual testing — from creating test cases to reporting bugs and working with SQL.
