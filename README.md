# SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Mateusz Stasik

## ABOUT ME

Hey! I’m Mateusz Stasik. I really enjoy apps that make everyday life simpler and smoother — and that’s why I’m diving into software testing. I want to make sure the tools we use work without hiccups and help people get things done easily.  

This portfolio shows what I’ve learned so far in manual testing — from creating test cases to reporting bugs and working with SQL. I’m excited to keep growing my skills and help deliver better, more reliable software.
